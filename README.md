## Usage

Clone the repo using `git clone <repo link>`.

You should then be able to open the project (navigate to the cloned folder) in Unity and it will generate the rest of the project files.

It is recommended that you use the git client or the command line rather than the git plugin for Unity as it's been known to brick the editor and doesn't play nice with git-lfs either way.
