## Usage

:warning: 
>We're using [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to handle the project's asset files. 
Make sure you have git-lfs installed before you start working with the repo. 

:warning:

Clone the repo using `git lfs clone <repo link>`, rather than the typical `git clone <repo link>`. 
The latter will still work, it will however be much slower when fetching all the assets.

You should then be able to open the project (navigate to the cloned folder) in Unity and it will generate the rest of the project files.

It is recommended that you use the git client or the command line rather than the git plugin for Unity as it's been known to brick the editor and doesn't play nice with git-lfs either way.
